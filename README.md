## Cloud Developer Starter Pack

The purpose of this doc is to share information helpful for developers who want to start their journey with cloud technologies like AWS, GCP or Azure. This is the very first initial version, doc will be updated in order to add more useful information related to development cloud native solutions. The content of the page is purely focused on the back-end side of programming - go programming language as it is the pillar of native cloud technologies and c# because it's cool and robust programming language (that's of course, just my view üòÅ) as well as on cloud native architecture and infrastructure as a code (Terraform).
